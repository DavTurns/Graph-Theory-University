**It is possible that you have to edit the input filepaths in order to make the programs work.**

## Lab 1
This program reads an undirected graph as a edge list from a file and determines the global max. degree and the global min. degree.

## Lab 2
The first task wants a constructor to be added to the "Graph" class that takes a file containing input data for an undirected graph.
Second, I implemented a methods which prints all Paths with longitude of 2 edges between 2 specific nodes.

## Lab 3
The beginning of the lab is the same as in lab 2 and lab 1. But now it was required to make a BFS (Breadth-first search) and to print all conexcomponents of the graph.

## Lab 4
Here I have to determine whether the graph is a binary tree or not and if so to print the nodes in preorder.

## Lab 5
This program implements the kruskal algorithm creating a minimal spanning tree.

## Lab 6
In the last assignment I have to implement the Hierholzer-algorithm in order to find an Eulerian circuit.
